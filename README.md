# Fix A Flat (FixAFlat)
Fix A Flat is an Android application that describes how to repair a bicycle's flat tire, step by step. It runs on Android 4.0.3 (the last version of Ice Cream Sandwich) and later devices.

## Getting Started
To run the application, download the project and copy it to where your copy of Android Studio expects to find projects. Make sure that you've installed the Android SDK tools for API level 23 (Android 6.0 - Marshmallow). Once the project is in place and the proper version of Android SDK tools is installed, simply build and run the project like any other.
